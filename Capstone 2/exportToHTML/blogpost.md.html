<span class="s2">NOAA’s Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory </span><span class="s1">(</span><span class="s2">GLERL</span><span class="s1">) </span><span class="s2">is responsible for collecting invasive species information in the Great Lakes area. We partnered with them to structure, analyze, and visualize their records on invasive species.</span>

<span class="s0">&gt; </span><span class="s2">The current understanding of many marine species, their links to other components of the ecosystems, and the benefits they provide to society is limited; in many instances, scientists have virtually no data. Adequate assessments have been performed for fewer than 60 percent of the key fish stocks and complexes, fewer than 25 percent of all protected species, and an even smaller percentage of the habitat upon which all of these species depend. In addition, it is not yet fully understood how complex ecosystems or individual species will respond either to a changing climate or available approaches to managing living marine resources.  </span><span class="s1">~ [</span><span class="s2">NOAA’s Goals</span><span class="s1">](https://www.performance.noaa.gov/goals/)</span>

<span class="s0">## </span><span class="s2">Invasive Species in Michigan Waterways</span>
<span class="s0">### </span><span class="s2">Introduction</span>

<span class="s2">Michigan is famous for its lakes and rivers—its very shape is determined by the Great Lakes.  However, globalization is impacting the ecosystems of Michigan’s waterways by introducing invasive species, </span><span class="s1">[</span><span class="s2">costing more than $100 million annually</span><span class="s1">](https://www.andersoneconomicgroup.com/Portals/0/upload/AEG%20-%20AIS%20Impact_%209-20-2016%20Public.pdf)</span><span class="s2">.  In addition, state and federal governments are spending enormous amounts of money to mitigate the impact of invasive species, for example, budgeting over </span><span class="s1">[</span><span class="s2">$858 million to prevent invasive carp from entering the Great Lakes</span><span class="s1">](https://apnews.com/article/technology-lake-michigan-army-fish-chicago-7e40381283991c37eec7a08552daddf4)</span><span class="s2">. </span>

<span class="s2">Dealing effectively with these invaders requires information, not only about the invaders themselves but also about the ecosystem in which they inhabit and their relationships with other species.  Much of this information is unavailable, inaccessible, or unconnected to related data. </span>

<span class="s0">### </span><span class="s2">Current State of Field</span>
 
<span class="s2">The information that is available comes primarily from researchers who document the behaviors and impacts specific species have on an ecosystem.  GLERL collects and organizes this information on invasive species in the Great Lakes region. Policy makers and researchers rely on the collected data to make regulations that maintain the health of America’s most prominent ecosystem.</span>

<span class="s2">Maintaining these records is not an easy task. GLERL scours everything from academic papers to homeowner association pamphlets to get the needed information and collects them into long </span><span class="s1">(</span><span class="s2">1000 page+</span><span class="s1">) [</span><span class="s2">technical reports and annual updates</span><span class="s1">](https://www.glerl.noaa.gov/pubs/#techRep)</span><span class="s2">.  Reviewing the reports and associated research and entering the compiled information into their database has always been a challenge.  </span>

<span class="s2">For our project, we structured, analyzed, and visualized GLERL records on invasive species.   As sportsman, conservationists, and data scientists we seek to maintain the beauty and vitality of Great Lakes waterways for our children and grandchildren.</span>

<span class="s0">## </span><span class="s2">Increased Available Research Findings by 750%</span>
<span class="s0">### </span><span class="s2">Structuring Data</span>

<span class="s2">We algorithmically processed 3,300 pages of technical reports and created 3,100 structured scientific findings that will be added to the </span><span class="s1">[</span><span class="s2">Great Lakes Aquatic Nonindigenous Species Information System </span><span class="s1">(</span><span class="s2">GLANSIS</span><span class="s1">)](https://www.glerl.noaa.gov/glansis/)</span><span class="s2">, increasing their entries by over 750%.</span>

<span class="s2">The technical reports detail the potential impacts of invasive species on an ecosystem and are freely available on their website.</span>

<span class="s1">![</span><span class="s2">img_7.png</span><span class="s1">](</span><span class="s2">img_7.png</span><span class="s1">)</span>

<span class="s2">In order to make the information more accessible, GLERL dedicates a portion of their research database </span><span class="s1">(</span><span class="s2">GLANSIS</span><span class="s1">) </span><span class="s2">to records dealing with possible invasive species and their potential impact on the environment.  These records, called impact statements, are organized by invasive species and include information on the source of the findings and the other species impacted.</span>

<span class="s1">![</span><span class="s2">img_8.png</span><span class="s1">](</span><span class="s2">img_8.png</span><span class="s1">)</span>

<span class="s2">Converting the unstructured nature of the reports into the structured form of the impact statements has always been a challenge for GLERL. Our team processed more than six years of reports, combined them with ten other tables, and prepared a final file for entry into the database.</span>

<span class="s2">We located and extracted the text related to the impact statements, by reading the PDF files and converting them to plain text, and then used regex to locate section headings and key phrases and a naïve Bayes classification algorithm to extract relevant information. We matched 60% of the impact statements to references in GLERL’s database by extracting and normalizing their citations, matching them with references in the bibliography, and then to GLERL’s database.  </span>

<span class="s2">Extracting and identifying the impacted species in each statement proved to be a challenge.  Species were referenced at different levels of taxonomic rank </span><span class="s1">(</span><span class="s2">kingdom, phylum, class, order, family, genus, and species</span><span class="s1">) </span><span class="s2">and sometimes by one of their many common names, so we quickly standardized our naming conventions.  With NOAA’s advice, we opted to use the naming conventions in the predator-prey relationships </span><span class="s1">(</span><span class="s2">see below</span><span class="s1">)</span><span class="s2">. We built dictionaries to translate the names into a common ontology, and match up the species ID used to invaders and </span><span class="s1">[</span><span class="s2">TSNs</span><span class="s1">](https://www.itis.gov/) </span><span class="s2">to impacted species.</span>

<span class="s2">Each record was missing two critical values that could not be found in the technical reports</span><span class="s1">: </span><span class="s2">study type and study location.  These two values are based on the judgement of the researcher entering the report, and sometimes researchers do not agree.  We trained Random Forest Classifiers on existing impact statements and used them to impute the values for the impact statements we had extracted.  Through careful feature engineering and vectorization of the title, abstract, and journal, we were able to achieve a 73% accuracy for the study type and 80% for the study location with an 80-20 train-test split, with only 992 labeled examples, a value limited by the incomplete information about many of the references </span><span class="s1">(</span><span class="s2">missing abstracts, journals, etc.</span><span class="s1">)</span><span class="s2">.  We retrained the classifier on the complete set and then imputed the data.</span>

<span class="s2">Lastly, we compiled a completed table and exported it in a correctly formatted Excel file for upload into the database.</span>

<span class="s0">### </span><span class="s2">Notes, Lessons &amp; Ethical Considerations</span>
<span class="s0">- </span><span class="s2">Choose the Right Library</span><span class="s1">: </span><span class="s2">The libraries used to extract the text varied in extraction accuracy </span><span class="s1">(</span><span class="s2">90% to 100%</span><span class="s1">) </span><span class="s2">and processing time </span><span class="s1">(</span><span class="s2">30 min to 30 seconds</span><span class="s1">) </span><span class="s2">depending on the library used.  Test several options for performance before committing to a specific library. </span>
<span class="s0">- </span><span class="s2">Beware Inconsistencies</span><span class="s1">: </span><span class="s2">We extracted information that had been compiled by hand and matched it to a specific data model. Differences in spelling, format, and spacing required careful consideration and introduced potential uncertainty into our findings.</span>
<span class="s0">- </span><span class="s2">Information Availability</span><span class="s1">: </span><span class="s2">Organizations are sometimes reluctant to provided unfettered access to their data.  Clearly state your complete expectations and requirements for data access in the negotiation stage</span><span class="s1">: </span><span class="s2">come to a clear understanding before you proceed.</span>
<span class="s0">- </span><span class="s2">Ontology Matters</span><span class="s1">: </span><span class="s2">The different levels present in the naming conventions of the species, references, and waterways </span><span class="s1">(</span><span class="s2">see below</span><span class="s1">) </span><span class="s2">made combining datasets more art than science.  Consult with domain experts and heed their advice. </span>
<span class="s0">- </span><span class="s2">Understand Your Data</span><span class="s1">: </span><span class="s2">Datasets vary in a myriad of ways, including accuracy, completeness, and specificity.   Understand and clearly communicate the limitations of your data, so users can make informed decisions.  </span>
<span class="s0">- </span><span class="s2">Pipeline First</span><span class="s1">: </span><span class="s2">Quickly producing results in each step and learning how the datasets interact saves time downstream.  Follow the Pareto Principle and get the 80% done first—then go back and polish.</span>
<span class="s0">- </span><span class="s2">Missing Data</span><span class="s1">: </span><span class="s2">Data collection varies considerably and is neither uniform nor random. The quantity of information collected does not reflect its impact. Review the density of data and clearly communicate what might be overlooked.</span>

<span class="s0">## </span><span class="s2">Pioneered Network Model of Invasive Species</span>
<span class="s0">### </span><span class="s2">Building Networks</span>

<span class="s2">Traditional databases relate tables to other tables, and when properly designed allow users to quickly determine direct relationships between entries.  However, finding indirect relationships between data and exploring the relationships between multiple entries in these systems is difficult.  Graphs explicitly model relationships between entries as a network, allowing users to explore direct and indirect relationships between multiple entries and opening up entirely new ways of analyzing systems.  </span>

<span class="s0">### </span><span class="s2">Species Network</span>

<span class="s2">We created a species graph that allows researchers for the first time to discover invaders impacting selected species and identify indirect relationships between species.</span>

<span class="s2">The species graph was based on the predator-prey relationships we extracted from GLERL’s foodwebs and represented as a two-column dataframe </span><span class="s1">(</span><span class="s2">predator, prey</span><span class="s1">)</span><span class="s2">.  We normalized the species in the impacter-impacted relationships in the impact statements, combined it with the normalized predator-prey relationships, represented it as a graph using NetworkX. </span>

<span class="s2">To get a measure of how species impacted each other, we calculated the shortest path </span><span class="s1">(</span><span class="s2">if any</span><span class="s1">) </span><span class="s2">between each pair of species and saved the results as a three column dataframe.</span>

<span class="s0">### </span><span class="s2">Waterways Network</span>

<span class="s2">We created a waterways invasion graph that lets researchers identify the possible risk of invasive species entering new waterways</span>

<span class="s2">We wanted to model regional lakes and rivers as a graph, so we could determine the potential spread of invasive species.  </span><span class="s1">[</span><span class="s2">USGS’s National Hydrography Dataset </span><span class="s1">(</span><span class="s2">NHDPlus HR</span><span class="s1">)](https://www.usgs.gov/core-science-systems/ngp/national-hydrography/nhdplus-high-resolution)  </span><span class="s2">includes a table of waterway intersections and waterways in and out.  To create our waterway network, we pruned and restructured the data as a table of paired waterways, one connected to the other, and then added the name of the waterway.</span>

<span class="s1">![</span><span class="s2">img_9.png</span><span class="s1">](</span><span class="s2">img_9.png</span><span class="s1">)</span>

<span class="s2">Next, we connected a list of invasive species observations GLERL maintains to another waterway network by downloading and flattening two geojson files, extracting 2 million geographical points representing regional lakes and rivers, and then used </span><span class="s1">[</span><span class="s2">ScyPy’s cKDTree</span><span class="s1">](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.spatial.cKDTree.html) </span><span class="s2">to find the closest waterway for each observation.  We mapped the waterway names to the waterway ID and outputted the result as a two-column waterway relationship table.</span>

<span class="s2">We created the network by importing the table into NetworkX, and then calculated the shortest distance between each species and waterway and saved it as a normalized table with three values </span><span class="s1">(</span><span class="s2">species, waterway, and distance</span><span class="s1">) </span><span class="s2">representing the potential spread of each invasive species in each waterway.</span>

<span class="s0">### </span><span class="s2">Notes, Lessons &amp; Ethical Considerations</span>
<span class="s0">- </span><span class="s2">Standardize Representation</span><span class="s1">:  </span><span class="s2">Maintaining consistent representation of data is essential, particularly when dealing with multiple unstructured datasets.  Exploring your data and getting a pipeline working early on is essential for efficient progress.</span>
<span class="s0">- </span><span class="s2">Use Graphs</span><span class="s1">: </span><span class="s2">The world is built of networks. Using graphs to represent data allows you to explore data in completely new ways and identify important indirect relations between entites that a database cannot.</span>
<span class="s0">- </span><span class="s2">Uncertainty Cascade</span><span class="s1">: </span><span class="s2">The downstream effects of generalization and uncertainty grow over time.  As George Box said in 1978, “All models are wrong, but some of them are useful.”  The importance of communicating this clearly cannot be overestimated.</span>
<span class="s0">- </span><span class="s2">Incomplete Research</span><span class="s1">: </span><span class="s2">NOAA’s foodwebs and the invasive impact findings are incomplete, so our networks should only be used as a starting point for research in these areas.  Lack of information does not equate to lack of relationship.</span>
<span class="s0">- </span><span class="s2">Beware Unknown Basics</span><span class="s1">: </span><span class="s2">Information availability is independent of information importance.  With no information available on existing species in a waterway, we had to drop one main visualization.  Double check the availability of all data before you start.</span>

<span class="s0">## </span><span class="s2">Made Models Accessible to Researchers</span>
<span class="s0">### </span><span class="s2">Inventing Visualizations</span>

<span class="s2">We created easy-to-understand visualizations that allow researchers to explore the spread and impact of invasive species in Great Lakes waterways.</span>

<span class="s0">### </span><span class="s2">Architecture</span>

<span class="s2">We used a thin, lightweight application on the front end housing the logic to make easy-to-use visualizations and display text with tools including React, React Ploytly.js, and React Mapbox-gl.js.  We built the layout using React and JSX, the logic and API requests with Javascript, and UI components outside the visualizations with Material-UI. Delivering only necessary data to the frontend allows the visualizations to load quickly and be viewed from anywhere </span>
<span class="s2">Internet is available. </span>

<span class="s2">To process most of the data, we set up the database as a Google Cloud Project </span><span class="s1">(</span><span class="s2">GCP</span><span class="s1">) </span><span class="s2">Cloud SQL using a PostgreSQL database.  For the backend, we use a Flask REST application with an MVC architecture exposing an API that serves necessary data to the frontend as a JSON object.  We use Kubernetes for continuous integration and continuous deployment </span><span class="s1">(</span><span class="s2">CICD</span><span class="s1">) </span><span class="s2">and GitHub actions to make the system easy to manage and change.  </span>

<span class="s0">### </span><span class="s2">River Plot</span>

<span class="s2">We created an interactive map showing the existence and potential spread of a selected invasive species.</span>

<span class="s2">Our waterway network was connected to the geojson file with named waterways.  Then, we mapped the existence and potential spread of invasive species onto vector tiles as layers on a map using Mapbox and represented the distance from an observation in a different layer with color allowing the map to render vast amounts of data very quickly.</span>

<span class="s1">![</span><span class="s2">img_10.png</span><span class="s1">](</span><span class="s2">img_10.png</span><span class="s1">)</span>

<span class="s2">As you can see above, grass carp are present in many rivers </span><span class="s1">(</span><span class="s2">shown in red</span><span class="s1">) </span><span class="s2">near the University of Michigan Campus in Ann Arbor.  In rivers shown in orange and yellow, the species has not yet been observed but there is a risk of invasion due to their connections to invaded waterways, while in rivers shown in blue, the risk is potentially limited by the lack of connected invader waterways.  </span>

<span class="s0">### </span><span class="s2">Ripple Plot</span>

<span class="s2">We invented the ripple plot which allows nth order relationships to be displayed in an easy-to-understand fashion and created an interactive version to display species relationships allowing researchers to see the direct and indirect impact of invasive species.</span>

<span class="s2">Displaying the first to third order species impacting or being impacted by invasive species in an easy-to-understand manner is completely new.  Until now, the information has never been available and, according to GLERL, this type of representation has never been used in the field.  In order to keep the visualization as simple as possible, we created a ripple plot that shows both the direct and indirect impacts of invasive species.</span>

<span class="s1">![</span><span class="s2">img_12.png</span><span class="s1">](</span><span class="s2">img_12.png</span><span class="s1">)</span>

<span class="s2">The plot above shows the direct and indirect impacts of a killer shrimp on the Great Lakes ecosystem directly impacting amphipods </span><span class="s1">(</span><span class="s2">1st order</span><span class="s1">) </span><span class="s2">and indirectly impacting bacteria </span><span class="s1">(</span><span class="s2">2nd order</span><span class="s1">) </span><span class="s2">and smelt </span><span class="s1">(</span><span class="s2">3rd order</span><span class="s1">)</span><span class="s2">.</span>

<span class="s1">![</span><span class="s2">img_14.png</span><span class="s1">](</span><span class="s2">img_14.png</span><span class="s1">)</span>

<span class="s2">In the plot above, chinook is the impacted species and the concentric circles show invasive species that directly or indirectly impact it.  The first order impacting invaders directly impact the chinook and include alewife and pink salmon, while the second order invaders impact a species </span><span class="s1">(</span><span class="s2">invasive or not</span><span class="s1">) </span><span class="s2">that directly impacts chinook, and the third species impacts as species that impacts a species that impacts chinook.  Including only invaders focuses attention on changes to the pressure on a given species.</span>

<span class="s0">### </span><span class="s2">Species Network</span>

<span class="s2">We created a network visualization tool showing how a single species relates to the other species in the ecosystem.</span>

<span class="s1">![</span><span class="s2">img_15.png</span><span class="s1">](</span><span class="s2">img_15.png</span><span class="s1">)</span>

<span class="s0">### </span><span class="s2">Findings, Methodology &amp; Ethical Considerations</span>

<span class="s0">- </span><span class="s1">[</span><span class="s2">Coastline Paradox</span><span class="s1">](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/CoastlineParadox.html): </span><span class="s2">The length of a coastline increases as the size of the ruler used to measure it decreases. Representing the network as a network of named waterways made the visualization easier to process and understand but ignored the potential impact of unnamed waterways. Focusing on individual segments would have preserved more locality and possible underfitted the data.  Understand the ruler you use, and its impact on the final results.</span>
<span class="s0">- </span><span class="s2">Impact Complexity</span><span class="s1">:  </span><span class="s2">We represented impacts as one species impacting another, but relationships are rarely so one-sided.  The ease of understanding also limits a broader analysis.  Know and communicate the limitations of the representations you choose.</span>
<span class="s0">- </span><span class="s2">Citation Omissions</span><span class="s1">:  </span><span class="s2">GLERL always cites the source of findings, but we opted for a simplified representation.  Adding links to the source of the data would properly credit the original findings and provide researchers with a more contextualized view. </span>
<span class="s0">- </span><span class="s2">Inland Foodwebs</span><span class="s1">: </span><span class="s2">Foodweb data for inland waterways was not available, so our graph is incomplete.  Include the absence of data in your analysis and recognize your own limitations.</span>
<span class="s0">- </span><span class="s2">Measuring Impact</span><span class="s1">: </span><span class="s2">The networks treat all impacts equally. Adding strength to the impacts between species or waterways, or representing the species as agents in an agent-based model would allow richer and more accurate representations of the data.   </span>
<span class="s0">- </span><span class="s2">Oversimplification</span><span class="s1">: </span><span class="s2">Our representations provide a starting point for research by simplifying a highly complex system. Simple representations should never be used by themselves to make large decisions. </span>
<span class="s0">- </span><span class="s2">Lack of Peer Review</span><span class="s1">: </span><span class="s2">Our visualizations represent the data in GLERL’s database. However, they have not been reviewed by biological researchers, and the limitations of our approach have not been fully explored. Feedback from domain experts is priceless. </span>

<span class="s0">## </span><span class="s2">Endless Possibilities</span>
<span class="s0">### </span><span class="s2">Going Forward</span>
<span class="s0">- </span><span class="s2">Database Management</span><span class="s1">: </span><span class="s2">Automating the database will speed its growth and potentially expand its reach.</span>
<span class="s0">- </span><span class="s2">Inland Foodwebs</span><span class="s1">: </span><span class="s2">Adding foodwebs and species information for inland waterways will allow visualizations to be tailored to selected waterbodies.</span>
<span class="s0">- </span><span class="s2">Link to Resources</span><span class="s1">: </span><span class="s2">Adding more information about the data itself and adding links to more information will aid researchers in gaining a more complete understanding of the ecosystem and aid in their research. </span>
<span class="s0">- </span><span class="s2">Additional Graphs</span><span class="s1">: </span><span class="s2">Adding information on water quality or flow rates will both increase the accuracy of the model and allow more complex interactions to be identified and explored. </span>

<span class="s0">## </span><span class="s2">Smarter Systems from Data</span>
<span class="s0">### </span><span class="s2">Conclusion</span>

<span class="s2">By substantially Increasing the available findings in GLERL’s database, pioneering the representation of invader impacts and invaded waterways as networks, and inventing new tools for researchers to explore these relationships, we believe we have significantly advanced </span><span class="s1">[</span><span class="s2">GLERL’s mission to research ecosystem dynamics, integrate physical and ecological modeling and forecasting, and develop observing systems and technology</span><span class="s1">](https://www.glerl.noaa.gov/)</span><span class="s2">. </span>

<span class="s2">We are confident that our findings and tools will contribute to a smarter, more integrated approach to ecological data, guide future research, and provide a basis for future systems.  More importantly, we believe it will be leveraged to protect and conserve the ecosystems of Great Lakes waterways for ourselves and our descendants.</span>
